
To whom it concerns, 

Thanks for taking the time to take a look at the code and web page for this project. 

Here is a summary of what has been commited :

1 - I created a JSON formatted .txt file from the Excel sheet using the code in 'create_json_file.php' (using SheetJS library) 

2 - When the index.php page is opened, it pulls the data from the file - called 'datanew.txt' 

3 - There is a waiting message when you first go to the web page, which waits until the data is pulled in from the 'datanew.txt' file before showing page's content

4 - All 680 results are pulled, but using jQuery only the first 100 are shown on the page. 

5 - You can then show the other rows depending on the choice selected from the dropdown. 

6 - There is also a 'Cruise Companies' section which just provides a set of links to different cruise companies, with a filter parameter using Angular

7 - The page is styled using Foundation CSS, and some media queries, which means it looks relatively tidy on small and medium devices too. 

8 - There is a very simple banner functionality with rotating slides at the top of the page. 


Best regards,
